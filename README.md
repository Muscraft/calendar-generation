# toml-to-ical
`toml-to-ical` is a simple command-line utility for generating [iCalendar][ical] documents from
a list of events in TOML format.

It is intended for use in open source projects which have a public calendar with meetings. Instead
of using Google Calendar or some other calendar service, just generate the calendar from a list of
events in TOML format and generate and host the calendar using something like GitHub Actions/Pages
in CI.
